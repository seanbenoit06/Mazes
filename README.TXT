This project was a creative project I did for class in high school. We were tasked with creating and traversing mazes using 
carving and pathfinding algorithms. Algorithms used for maze generation included Binary Tree, SideWinder, Wilson, and Aldous Broder,
with Wilson being my favorite. This is also where I learned about depth-first-search from a friend of mine while implementing
a heatmap for the maze. This is a simple, fun, project where I enjoyed coding something I found interesting from scratch. This latest 
version of the project includes a graphics client, where you can traverse a maze in a Legend of Zelda-like fashion. Hope you enjoy :).

To play, run main in GraphicsClient and use your arrow keys.
